# MoodScope
Team : The Boys
We are here to have fun and innovate while having good food.

In India, it is considered to be “weak” to approach a mental counselor. So many people in need of help hesitate to seek help and thereby improve their situation.
Not addressing this may lead the person to enter a downward spiral.

What we propose is to gamify the experience of seeking help, through small tasks that give reward points on completion. Awarding points act as a positive feedback. 
These tasks will be suggested to a user based on a small questionnaire to gauge his/her mood. 
Examples can be : reading a book, going for a stroll, take dog for a walk
Awards can be : have an ice cream, give health points, go for a small picnic, play a simple game, take a nap.
Empowering people to realize their ability to take control and take actionable steps to obtain a positive impact on their mental wellbeing.
