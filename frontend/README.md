## **Manifesto**

"Nothing can bring you peace but yourself."

_— Ralph Waldo Emerson_

## **What is ebb?**

ebb is a web app that gamifies stress/anxiety/depression management in an actionable manner to provide relief. We developed ebb to address the problem statement of using technology to aid issues centered around stress/anxiety/depression.

We want to help people with stress/anxiety/depression realise their ability to take control of their condition and take actionable steps to obtain a positive impact on their mental health.

An immersive task-based journey that inspires people towards self-discovery and emotional maturity to gain the ability to be fully present in the moment.

## **Inspiration**

Project ebb is inspired by Carl Pullein's blog post "[Productivity is not about doing more work.](https://medium.com/carl-pullein/productivity-is-not-about-doing-more-work-25a0bb1fdf22)".

### Productivity is not about doing more work.

_— Carl Pullein_

> There’s a perception that to become more productive means doing more work. Yet that is not the purpose of becoming more productive at all. Becoming more productive is about becoming more effective at getting your work done so you can spend more time doing the things you want to do with the people you love being with.

## **How?**

1. ebb quantifies the user's stress/anxiety/depression level to be spent on a prescribed set of activities before the day ends. By doing so, users inadvertently take actionable steps to deal with their condition.

2. Users then decide on the activities to spend their days on, the reward they get for completing them (to positively reinforce the habit of taking actionable steps to deal with their condition).

3. When users check back in, ebb prompts them to reward themselves, then proceeds to re-evaluate their stress/anxiety/depression levels.

4. If their stress/anxiety/depression levels are not up to mark, users get to re-attempt the challenge with their re-evaluated levels, restarting the whole process.

Productivity tools and mental health apps usually take the form of mood trackers, which are useful, but offers very little that's actionable beyond telling the user what they should do.

ebb focuses on getting users to take action by helping them to visualize their tasks that needs to be completed before the day ends. Spending time on such task is equivalent to doing activities that could lower your negative emotion levels, and we are not aware of any other apps that does something similar in terms of gamification.

ebb helps to solidify the habit of taking actionable steps to deal with one's condition by getting users to pick a reward prior, then administering it after they’ve completed their tasks. The premise for this idea is positive reinforcement, in which learning accompanied by positive feelings are more likely to be remembered. Thus, the associating of rewards with the successful spending of credits is effective in encouraging users to deal with their condition in an actionable manner in the long run.
